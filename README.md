# THERMAL VIDEODIFF (TVD): A DIFFUSION ARCHITECTURE FOR THERMAL VIDEO SYNTHESIS

Machine perception gathers information about its surroundings
through sophisticated sensors. Thermal sensors offers
scalable perception in conditions of low visibility such as
night time, smoke or fog. However, integrating thermal
data with deep learning algorithms is a challenge because of
scarcity of thermal data due to high cost of thermal sensors.
In this paper, we propose for the first time, a deep learning
based framework for thermal video synthesis as an affordable
alternative to purchasing costly thermal imaging devices.
Here, we have introduced diffusion model for estimating
thermal videos from videos in the visible spectrum. Results
show that our Thermal VideoDiff (TVD) is capable of synthesizing
high fidelity video samples and captures temperature
variations from thermal data effectively. Our work addresses
the challenge posed by the scarcity of thermal data, as well as
brings deep learning to the domain of infrared video generation,
enabling research and development in infrared domain.
